# Rubeus-2023
Rubeus - Firestorm Robotics (FRC 6341)'s robot for 2023. Name not official yet.

This is written with FirestormRoboticsLibrary, which is *totally* not largely being developed specifically for this robot.

We ain't stingy with our code! Use whatever you like. We'd prefer if you gave us credit, but what do we look like, lawyers?

We do it all in C++. A lot of people all throughout FRC say Java is better but since we switched to C++ we have never needed outside help.  
Makes you wonder.

Seriously, Java is a dead language, everybody codes in Kotlin for JVM. Rust is a better language than C++ and we need to start using it on robots, but we already know C++ and it does teach a lot of useful things, so this year we ain't doing anything craszy. Well, we *are* doing craszy things, but we're doing them in C++.
